Scenario 1: Allocate and release memory
Description:
Allocate a large amount of same sized data and then release it in a different order created in.

Test scenario:
We will test the performance between the c++ malloc function against our alloc function and measure the time it takes to alloc the same amount of objets/data.

We will also test the capability of releasing data in a different order than created.

Variables:
- Size per object
- Number of objects
- Allocator
- Allocation/deallocation pattern

Scenario 2: Work by frame
Description:
Allocate data which to be used in a single frame and then deallocate the data before the next frame.

Test scenario:
Test the marker system by setting a marker and allocate memory for one frame, then clear to marker.
By get a new marker and compare it to the old one.

- Size per object
- Number of objects
- Allocator
- Allocation pattern

Stack allocator Scenario: without memory alignment
Description:
Check the performance impact when not using any form of memory size checks when allocate new data on the stack.

Test scenario:



Stack allocator Scenario: with memory alignment
Description:
Check the performance impact when using any form of memory size checks when allocating new data on the stack.

Test scenario:
