General approach
We will code a prototype resource manager, our resource manager from big-game course will serve as inspiration due
to the similarities of how the prototype resource manager will function.

This assignment will use the allocators from the previous assignment.

We are debating whether we should use compressed or not compressed assets file. Will we focus on performance or memory management?

Considerations
Our old resource manager has no support for multi-threading. 

Testing scenarios
Loading different levels. The levels should have some resources in common to each other to test
that the common resources isn't deallocated when loading the level and this is done with streaming
content in the background.

Another test scenario could be having random allocation and deallocating of resources.
