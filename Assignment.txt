ASS 2 design

-- Asset identifiers --

File path?
+ More natural
+ Easier debugging
- Slower
- More difficult to detect duplicates

Integer?
+ Easy to handle
+ Fast
+/- Hides filename

Hash?
+ Fast
+/- Hides filename
+ Automatic detection of duplicates
+/- Version handling

-- Handling different resource types --

Interface for registering resource loaders with a resource type.
Resource index contains resource type. (8 ASCII characters)
Attempt to load a resource type without a registered resource raises an error.


-- Loading a resource --

Provide the resource manager with an asset identifier and an action to perform when done.
Callback for reporting progress per file?
Prevent unloading of soon to be used assets, by marking resources as to be loaded.


-- Unloading resources --

Resources are cached until the space is needed.




-- specialized file format instead of zip? --

+ faster to read
+ flexible
+ no need for 3-party programs to make the resorce file
- development time
- harder to resue in other programs
CONCLUSION
no.
We will use zip file with complimenting index file,
but start with a non-compressed format.

be able to read a file containing multiple references to other objects

use a singel thread to load from disk and thread-pool to prepare the data for the system



scenario 1
5 rooms in a row having the room we are in and the adjecent rooms also loaded
