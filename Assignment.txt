-- Handling different resource types --

Interface for registering resource loaders with a resource type.
Resource index contains resource type.
Attempt to load a resource type without a registered resource raises an error.


-- Loading a resource --

Provide the resource manager with an asset identifier and an action to perform when done.
Callback for reporting progress per file?
Prevent unloading of soon to be used assets, by marking resources as to be loaded.


-- Unloading resources --

Resources are cached until the space is needed.
